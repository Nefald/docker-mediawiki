MCRecipe

Version 1.0

An extension facilitates minecraft recipe rendering for minecraft modders
building their wiki.

===Installation===

Put "MCRecipe" into "/extension" folder, and add these codes into
"LocalSettings.php" to enable MCRecipe:

<code>
require_once "$IP/extensions/MCRecipe/MCRecipe.php";
</code>

===Usage===

MCRecipe now provides three types of craft recipes: shaped recipes, shapeless
recipes, and smelting recipes. They can be insert into wiki by this format:

{{#recipe:
<recipe type>|
<item database>|
<recipe input>|
<recipe output>
}}

Recipe type can be: "craft", "craft shapeless", or "smelt".

Item database consists a list of item definitions. Each item information is
surrounded by a pair of parentheses, and there is no padding between items.
Here is an example of a item database defination:

(Iron_Ingot)(Gold_Ingot,Gold Ingot,GoldIngot.png)(Coal,Charcoal,Charcoal.png)

An item in the database has this format:

(<item link>[,<item name>[,<item image>]])

Also, you could add external link or image using square brackets, here's an
example:

([http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Iron_Ingot],Iron Ingot,[http://somehost/somepath/IronIngot.png])

Note that there's no space after the comma.

Recipe input is a list of input item of a recipe. For crafting recipe, there's
9 inputs separated by "|". Each input is a index to the item database. An input
can also be a array of indexes, which makes an animated crafting slot.

Recipe output shares the same format as each recipe input.

Here's some input/output examples:

-1			# Empty slot
0			# Load first item of the database
[0,1]		# Repeatly show first and second items of the database
[-1,0]
{index:0,number:8}		# 8x the first item
{index:0,number:0.5}	# First item with half damaged
[{index:0,number:3},0]

Here's some full examples of a crafting recipe:

{{#recipe:craft
|(Iron_Ingot)(Stick)(Iron_Sword)
|-1| 0|-1
|-1| 0|-1
|-1| 1|-1
|2
}}

{{#recipe:craft
|(Oak_Planks)(Brich_Planks)(Stick)
|-1|-1|-1
|-1|[0,1]|-1
|-1|[0,1]|-1
|{index:2,number:4}
}}
